This file contains the instruction to run the code.

My source code reads the input from a file.
1)  Create a file named "input.txt" which contains the machine code.
2)  Put this input file in the same directory where the source code is located.
3)  Now, run the code using these commands : 
        1) g++ dis_assembler.cpp
        2) ./a.out 
4)  This generates a file named "output.txt" which contains the disassembled code.
